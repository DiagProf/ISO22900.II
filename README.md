ISO22900.II-Sharp handles all the details of operating with unmanaged ISO 22900-2 spec library (also called D-PDU-API) and lets you deal with the important stuff.

The [ISO 22900-2](https://www.iso.org/standard/62490.html) friendly name is D-PDU-API both are synonymous for a software interface description. D-PDU-API can live alone but was normally designed in use with ISO 22900-X and ISO 22901-X in mind. All this spec libraries has the goal to make automotive diagnostic data interchangeable. In case of ISO 22900-2 this correctly means modular vehicle communication interface (MVCI or VCI) can be exchanged through MVCI from another manufacturer if both support ISO 22900-2.

Extract from 22900-2: *"The purpose of ISO 22900-2 is to ensure that diagnostic and reprogramming applications from any vehicle or tool manufacturer can operate on a common software interface and can easily exchange MVCI protocol module implementations."*

## A bit of history with philosophy

Some time ago every diagnostic tool used its own proprietary VCI (many small tools still do that today). That made it impossible to replace the VCI with another (other manufacturer, etc.). The end users then (typically the workshop) has the problem that they need 3 different VCIs for 3 different diagnostic tools. The OEMs had also a problem with proprietary VCI interfaces and the result worse with every new generation of diagnostic tool they deliver a new VCI. Of course in general every new VCI gets better (faster, wireless connections, new protocols etc.) but the old VCI was unsueable because the interface definition to the VCI was broken. 

The problem has already been recognized and interface specifications such as SAE J2534(PassThru) and RP1210a were created. PassThru capable VCIs are heavily used for ECU reprogramming therefore they are more widely used in America than e.g. in Europe. European vehicle manufacturers don't like to give out their ecu flash data :-(  especially for independent workshops (but for America they have to do it). RP1210a is used in the heavy-duty vehicle field. The RP1210 API is created for various flavors of Microsoft Windows as OS. Which limits the use very much.

From my point of view, the biggest advantages of the D-PDU-API are:

- asynchronous ECU communication

- can handle negative ECU responses internally

- the parameters for the vehicle protocols are also part of the specification (at least for the widely used protocols)

- the parameters and the vehicle protocols are named **completely**, **uniformly** and the **effectiveness** of the parameter is determined

If you look at the around 29 functions from ISO22900-2 it is initially difficult to see how a user-friendly API can be built from them. I think the idea of one API fits all and is easy to use is not so straightforward. For example it would be possible to build an API with the 29 functions that looks and works like the J2534 API or to build an API that fits well under a diagnostic-server but can also be used on its own. For example it would be possible to build an API with the 29 functions that looks and works like the J2534 API or to build an API that fits well under a diagnostic server but can also be used on its own. If I wanted to build an API out of the 29 functions that looks like a J2534 API, I might name it Api2534. In order to understand this even more clearly, I would like to briefly explain how I split ISO22900-2 in order to transfer it from a C API to the object world.

1. If you look at the C functions, almost all of them only have one return value, which is passed to the function as a call by reference. The real return value is used for error handling. In C# the return value now throws an exception and the old call by reference value is now the return value of the function.
